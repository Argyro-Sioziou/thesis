\section{Thesis Outline}
The main goal of this thesis is to experiment with the use of clustering algorithms with categorical data and identify the value of its results in the formation of services, and creation of marketing strategies in the turistic sector. Firstly, it defines machine learning and its categories, concentrating mainly on clustering and its applications on various sectors. Next, it analyses more in depth two clustering methods, the Kmeans and Agglomerative clustering. Further in the last section of the research background, a thorough description of two clustering applications in the turistic sector are illustrated. Then, the case study description, available data, methodology and results are presented. In conclusion, the results of the two algorithms are compared and their avail is discussed.
