    abstract = { The purpose of this study is to segment tourists according to the benefits they seek from a tourism destination. These segments are examined in order to find attractive segments for local wellbeing products. Segmentation in the context of wellbeing and wellness provides companies information on what kind of tourists are most interested in buying wellbeing products and contributes to the existing segmentation theory by using data driven segmentation in a situation where traditionally common-sense segmentation is used. The literature surrounding benefit segmentation in tourism is reviewed in order to find the benefits tourists might think of as important. The results of K-means cluster analysis show that tourists in the Savonlinna region, Finland, can be divided into four segments. The segments differ from each other in the benefits they seek and in interest in wellbeing holidays, but are quite similar regarding to their socio-demographic factors. This study shows that data-driven segmentation can be used to find markets for a certain product instead of a priori segmentation. The results also show that benefits sought have a strong influence on customer behavior but little in common with socio-economic factors, which proves the usefulness of benefit segmentation in tourism. Based on the results, tourism companies can find the most suitable segments for their offerings. }

    abstract = { One challenge in tourism market segmentation research is finding a statistical clustering method that can use data from the commonly used qualitative (categorical scale) survey instrument. Current proven methods require the use of quantitative (ratio or interval scale) data. However, quantitative survey instruments are seldom used. Many quantitative clustering methods severely restrict the number of attributes measured despite the fact that segmentation analysis works best when it measures all the multistate attributes that visitors identify as influencing their tourist experience. This study demonstrated that multistate categorical survey data could be successfully used. Using data from a bed-and-breakfast survey (229 guests), a two-stage analysis method was employed. First, multiple correspondence analysis was used to spatially map each of the attributes, and then cluster analysis was used to identify market segments. It is believed this method can be more practical in the field of applied tourism research. }

    abstract = { Recent advances in biotechnology allow researchers to measure expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously, across different conditions and over time. Analysis of data produced by such experiments offers potential insight into gene function and regulatory mechanisms. A key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the detection of groups of genes that manifest similar expression patterns. The corresponding algorithmic problem is to cluster multicondition gene expression patterns. In this paper we describe a novel clustering algorithm that was developed for analysis of gene expression data. We define an appropriate stochastic error model on the input, and prove that under the conditions of the model, the algorithm recovers the cluster structure with high probability. The running time of the algorithm on an n-gene dataset is O{n2[log(n)]c}. We also present a practical heuristic based on the same algorithmic ideas. The heuristic was implemented and its performance is demonstrated on simulated data and on real gene expression data, with very promising results. }
